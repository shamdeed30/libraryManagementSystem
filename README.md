*** A simple library management platform using Java for tracking books!

# Library Management System

## Introduction

The Library Management System is a project born out of a genuine passion for libraries and a practical need to streamline the library experience. With one of our team members working at the Colorado College Tutt Library and the rest of us being frequent library users, we identified an opportunity to enhance the library's services. Our goal was to create a user-friendly system that would allow library patrons to conveniently access information about available books, check in and out books, and get detailed book information, all from the comfort of their own devices.

## Project Overview

Our Library Management System is designed to replicate the online database search functionality offered by Tutt Library. It enables users to search for books by various criteria, such as book title, author, ID, or availability status, without the need to physically visit the library. The system is built on a foundation of organized data, with all book information stored in a "book.txt" file. This data is seamlessly accessed and managed by the system using the BookManager class.

## Features

Our Library Management System boasts a range of features to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly experience:

- **User Sign-Up/Login**: Users can create accounts or log in to access personalized features.
- **View Library**: Patrons can browse the entire library catalog.
- **Search by Keyword**: Users can search for books using keywords found in genres, author names, or titles.
- **Get Book Information**: Detailed book information can be retrieved using book IDs.
- **Check In/Out Book**: Patrons can perform book check-in and check-out operations.
- **Exit Program**: An easy way to exit the program gracefully.

## Installation

To get started with our Library Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Refer to your operating system's command prompt (Windows), Apple Terminal (macOS), or Linux Terminal to clone the repository.

2. Compile Java Files: Once the repository is cloned, compile the Java files to ensure everything is functional.

3. Launch the Program: Run the "Main.java" file to launch the program.

4. Follow Instructions: After launching the program, simply follow the sequential instructions provided on the command line.

**Note**: No external libraries or packages need to be downloaded. Everything required to run the program is included in the repository's main branch on GitHub.

## Enjoy the Library at Your Fingertips

We hope our Library Management System enhances your library experience by providing a convenient and efficient way to access and interact with the library's resources. Feel free to explore, search, and manage your library needs with ease.
